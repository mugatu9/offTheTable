# offTheTable

The problem:

Two or more people will meet to consume a meal together, yet each person has their own set of allergies and aversions.

The solution:

This application creates a food allergy and aversion report showing the combined list of all foods to avoid when planning a meal at home or in choosing a restaurant.

The user will create an object for each person who will be eating at the meal. For each person object, the user selects from a list of allergies and aversions. This lists of allergies and aversions for each person are stored as attributes within their respective person object. The attributes are then compiled in a group attribute object, and from that a final report will be generated showing the combined list of allergies and aversions (without duplication of particular allergies or aversions shared between different person objects).
